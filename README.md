# Logger2k17

Finally, a Logger that understands the lingo of modern times. No more of those meaningless log methods like `info` and `warn`. Now just use common terms like `fyi` and `wtf`. Want to log a message that's just for the engineers to see what's going on? Don't `debug` it. `wharrgarbl` it!
